<p>I'm a highly driven, self-motivated, full-stack developer with a strong business background. After coding in Ruby and HTML for a few years as a hobby, I enrolled in the Flatiron School for Web Development, focusing on HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, SQL, and React.<br><br>  I'm looking forward to building powerful web apps with other talented developers, as well as contributing to the open source community. I'm currently working on an app that allows users to create interactive videos, which they can embed on their own sites. I'll be providing a link with more info on this app very soon, but in the meantime check out my other projects below and let me know if you have any feedback.

If you’re a business in need of any web development, get in touch and we’ll have a chat!
